Useful Keybindings and Command Palette commands and shortcuts for sublime text by Ahmad Khattab
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I can open any .pdf or .html file directly from sublime using ctrl+alt+i as I installed "View in Browser" package (Useful for opening docs while coding)

- I can run questasim in batch mode directly from sublime as I installed "Terminus" package, I can open the shell either in the file or the folder directory from command palette -> Terminus (Useful to run the code after slight modifications)

- I can push the changes I have made directly from sublime to my github account without opening github as I installed git and connected it to my account, for every major update I will type the following commands to sync my local files with my repo:
  git add .
  git commit -m "your message"
  git push
  This is useful to go to any previous version I want and to document what are the updates in each modified version
